### About me

My name is Polina Koleva. I am a master student at the University of Freiburg, Germany. Moreover, I have been working as Java developer for more than 3 years. This summer I will participate in Google Summer of Code working with JBoss/Red Hat community. That's the main reason I have decided a blog is perfect way to share everything happening in the program. Hope you'll enjoy all my blog posts. Stay tuned.
